// This class demonstrates the most important integration point in the FaceTec Device SDK  -- The Session Request Processor.
//
// The Session Request Processor:
// - Implements an onSessionRequest function.  This function is called by the FaceTec Device SDK.
// - The onSessionRequest function is always passed a sessionRequestBlob, and you always send this blob up to your webservice, and into FaceTec Server.
// - The Session Request Blob is an encrypted string that you get and send to FaceTec Server.
// - Upon receiving the Response Blob from FaceTec Server, you will always call the sessionRequestCallback.processResponse function.
// - The Session Response Blob is an encrypted string that you get from FaceTec Server and pass back into the Device SDK.
// - The Session Request Callback  This is called when you receive a response from the FaceTec Server, with the blob that you receive from FaceTec Server.
// - The Session Request Callback provides a updateProgress function, where you can pass in the upload progress, controlling the Upload Screen Progress Bar.
//
// Notes:
// - Adding additional logic to this code is not allowed.  Do not add any additional logic outside of what is demonstrated in this Sample.
// - Adding additional asynchronous calls to this code is not allowed.  Only make your own additional asynchronous calls once the FaceTec UI is closed.
// - Adding code that modifies any App UI (Yours or FaceTec's) is not allowed.  Only add code that modifies your own App UI once the FaceTec UI is closed.
